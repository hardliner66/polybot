# Database
- Library:
    - diesel (i intuitively prefer this one for use behind an API)
        - not async
        - orm
    - sqlx
        - async
        - no orm
        - type checked SQL
- Database access is managed through an API server
    - Services communicate with API, API communicates with DB
- Communication:
    - https://www.grpc.io/
        - https://crates.io/crates/tonic
    - graphql

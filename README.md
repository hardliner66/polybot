# PolyBot
I want to create the most polyglot twitch-chat bot out there.

This will basically be my training ground for all languages and technologies.

## Planned Features
- Use many languages and technologies
- Use modern deployment (docker, kubernetes)
- Use at least one relational and at least one no-sql database
- Microservice architecture

## Non-Features
- I don't want to have every language technologie there is.
    - So probably no cobol, no php and a few others. The list might change in the future.
- Be usable for the general public.
    - If the project works for you, use it.
    - If it doesn't, I probably wont change it.
    - I try to keep everything as generic and adaptable as possible and I will accept feature and change requests
      if i think they are a good fit.
